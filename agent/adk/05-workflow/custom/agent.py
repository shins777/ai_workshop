# Module purpose:
# This module defines a custom CriticAgent that composes three sub-agents:
# - positive_critic_agent: produces positive feedback and highlights strengths
# - negative_critic_agent: produces constructive negative feedback or weaknesses
# - review_critic_agent: aggregates critiques and produces a final review
#
# The CriticAgent coordinates these sub-agents to produce structured critiques
# and an overall evaluation for a given input or document.

root_agent = CriticAgent(
    name = "critic_agent",
    positive_critic_agent = positive_critic,
    negative_critic_agent = negative_critic,
    review_critic_agent = review_critic,        
)

# The `root_agent` can be used directly by the ADK runtime or wired into
# higher-level workflows where a combined critique and review is required.
