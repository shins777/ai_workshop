# ADK 02 - Conversations Integration Guide

This directory consolidates examples related to conversational features of the ADK (Agent Development Kit), such as sessions, memory, events, and state management. Refer to each subfolder's README for detailed setup and execution instructions.

## Overview
- Purpose: Provide examples and patterns for conversational agent context management (memory, sessions, events, state, etc.).
- Primary use cases: maintaining long-term conversations, flow control based on state transitions, event-driven responses, memory-based retrieval and recall.

## Subfolder Summary
### memory (memory-based examples)  
  - Description: Examples for storing and retrieving memory, search integration, and usage with Vertex AI AgentEngine and in-memory backends.

### event (event-based examples)  
  - Description: Examples demonstrating flow control and output extension using events generated during user-agent interactions.

### session (session-aware examples)  
  - Description: Examples for maintaining session state and history, supporting in-memory, SQLite, and Agent Engine session backends, with per-turn detailed output and event examples.

### state (state-based examples)
